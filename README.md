### INSTRUCTIONS

Type in the search box the title of your favorite anime and click the "Add Anime" button to create a button with the name of the anime you chose. Click the button to get a list of the 10 best animated GIFs on that show. The GIFs are displayed as opaque static images at first, to start the animation simply click each image. I've also added a short message in case you're trying to create duplicate buttons.
